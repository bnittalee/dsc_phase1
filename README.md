<h2> Introduction </h2>

<p> This project analyzes data from IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes to explore which genres and movie studios are the most successful in the movie industry. Microsoft is looking to create a new movie studio to produce original video content and wants to know what type of films are doing best at the box office. This analysis provides insights for the client to help decide what movies to create.  </p>

## Questions 

<p> This project will address four questions about the movie industry:<br>
<br>1. What genre of movies are the most popular based on user ratings? 
<br>2. What are the top grossing movie genres?
<br>3. What movie content rating based on genre is the most popular?
<br>4. What are the top grossing movie studios?
</br>
</p>

## Data

### IMDB 

<p>The analysis examines a merged form of data from Box Office Mojo by IMDbPro and IMDB. BOM (Box Office Mojo) has data on domestic gross, and IMDB has data on movie genres.</p>

### Rotten Tomatoes

<p> Rotten Tomatoes contains data on genres, user ratings and movie content rating that is used to address popular genres based on content rating and popular genres based on user ratings. </p>

  # Recommendations 
  ### Genres
  <p> Microsoft should create either drama, comedy, adventure and action films. Adventure and comedy films are both the highest grossing genres.</p>
  
  ### Content Ratings
  <p> The highest rated movies are either not rated or a G Rating. Microsoft should focus on creating unrated and G-rated movies. </p>
  
  ### Studios 
  <p> The top grossing studio is Buena Vista which handles the distribution of films produced by Walt Disney Studios. Though Microsoft wants to create their own studio, itâ€™s worth looking to see who their competitors are. </p>
